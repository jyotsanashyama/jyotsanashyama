<h2>My Projects</h2>

<h3>1. Fraudulent Transaction Detection</h3>
<p>- Analyzed a dataset of 6,362,620 transactions, achieving an accuracy of 96.35% using Logistic Regression.<br>
  - Applied SMOTE to handle imbalance class and utilized StandardScaler to normalize the training and testing datasets.<br>
  - Achieved key performance metrices:- Precision: 97%, Recall: 96%, F1-score: 96%.<br>

<h3>4. Metro Network</h3>
<p>
  - An application that calculates the shortest path between two stations using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.<br>
  - Utilized a graph-based approach to map the metro stations, where each station is a nodes and connection is a weighted edge.<br>
  - Implemented graph traversal with an Adjacency List and Min-Heap Priority Queue for optimized shortest path calculation.<br>
  - Implemented various functions to display metro stations,taking source and destination as input from user, adding the stations
 as edge, calculating total distance.<br>
</p>


<h3>5. Jeevan Rakshan Blood Bank Website</h3>
<p>- Deployed a fully functioned Blood bank with interactive form for user information <br>
